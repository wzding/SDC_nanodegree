# Self Driving Car Nanodegreee
Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on 23 July, 2017.

The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with  Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv.


## Program Outline:
### Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision


#### 1. Deep Learning
- Project 2: [Traffic Sign Classifier](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project)
- Project 3: [Behavioural Cloning](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3)
    - Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network. 
    - Input data comprises steering angles and camera images captured by driving with a keyboard / mouse / joystick in the simulator.

#### 2. Computer Vision
- Project 1: [Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision)](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1)
- Project 4: [Advanced Lane Lines](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines)
- Project 5: [Vehicle Detection and Tracking](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/CarND-Vehicle-Detection)


### Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control

#### 1. Sensor Fusion
- Combining lidar and radar data to track objects in the environment using Kalman filters.
- Project 1: [Extended Kalman Filters](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project)
- Project 2: [Unscented Kalman Filters](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project)

#### 2. Localisation
- Locate a car relative to the world (Align a car and sensors to the map).
- Use particle filters to localise the vehicle.
- Project 3: [Kidnapped Vehicle (Particle Filters)](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project)

#### 3. Control
- Fundamental concepts of robotic control.
- Build algorithms to steer car and wheels so as to meet an objective.
- Project 4: [PID Controller](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/CarND-PID-Control-Project)
- Project 5: [Model Predictive Control]()


### Term 3: Path Planning, Concentrations, and Systems
#### 1. Path Planning
- Finding a sequence of steps in a maze (navigating cities, parking lots)
- Project 1: Path Planning (Driving a car down a highway with other cars in a simulator)

#### 2. Advanced Deep Learning: Semantic Segmentation
- Fully Convolutional Networks
- Inference Performance (Optimising NNs in TensorFlow for Inference Speed)
- Project 2: Semantic Segmentation (Identifying free space on the road in a video clip)

#### 3. Functional Safety
- Project 3: Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System

#### 4. System Integration
- Project 4: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car (Put your code in a self-driving car)
