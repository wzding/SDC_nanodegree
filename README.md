# Self Driving Car Nanodegreee
Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on 23 July, 2017.

The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with  Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv.


## Program Outline:
### Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision


#### 1. Deep Learning
- Project 2: [Traffic Sign Classifier](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Traffic-Sign-Classifier) 
- Project 3: [Behavioural Cloning](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Behavioral-Cloning)
    - Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network. 
    - Input data comprises steering angles and camera images captured by driving with a keyboard / mouse / joystick in the simulator.

#### 2. Computer Vision
- Project 1: [Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision)](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/LaneLines)
- Project 4: [Advanced Lane Lines](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Advanced-Lane-Lines)
- Project 5: [Vehicle Detection and Tracking](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Vehicle-Detection)


### Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control

#### 1. Sensor Fusion
- Combining lidar and radar data to track objects in the environment using Kalman filters.
- Project 1: [Extended Kalman Filters](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Extended-Kalman-Filter)
- Project 2: [Unscented Kalman Filters](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Unscented-Kalman-Filter)

#### 2. Localization
- Locate a car relative to the world (Align a car and sensors to the map).
- Use particle filters to localise the vehicle.
- Project 3: [Kidnapped Vehicle (Particle Filters)](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Kidnapped-Vehicle)

#### 3. Control
- Fundamental concepts of robotic control.
- Build algorithms to steer car and wheels so as to meet an objective.
- Project 4: [PID Controller](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/PID-Control)
- Project 5: [Model Predictive Control](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/MPC)


### Term 3: Path Planning, Concentrations, and Systems
#### 1. Path Planning
- Finding a sequence of steps in a maze (navigating cities, parking lots)
- Project 1: [Path Planning (Driving a car down a highway with other cars in a simulator)](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Path-Planning)

#### 2. Advanced Deep Learning: Semantic Segmentation
- Fully Convolutional Networks
- Inference Performance (Optimising NNs in TensorFlow for Inference Speed)
- project 2: [MobileNets and Single Shot Detection](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Object-Detection)
- Project 3: [Semantic Segmentation (Identifying free space on the road in a video clip)](https://github.com/wzding/Self_Driving_Car_Nanodegree/tree/master/Semantic-Segmentation)

#### 3. System Integration
- Project 4: [Programming a Real Self-Driving Car (Put your code in a self-driving car)](https://github.com/wzding/Electric_Eel_Capstone)
